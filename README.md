Master Thesis Project, Server and Desktop Application for Risk Management

This Project is/was developed durign my master thesis (should end in June'19).

Description Under Construction
------------------
Compile and run:
--------------------
With the arrival of Java11, the javaFX library was taken out of the core of java in version 9 and 10.

The Client needs either java 8 or java10+ with an javaFX module. (reccomended java8).
The Server should run in the same java version as the client.

The Server needs a MySql database in order to properrly function. (Will post a mockup DB ASAP).

Installing:
---
Server:
- Create a Log files and update the path in the main file. (Server)
- Create Datatabase;
- Configure database name and password (DBConnection)

Client:
- Change Server IP and Port

The tool can be reutilized to any kind of risk, not only cyber risks.
change the risk and newrisk classes, and replace by your risk of choice.
